When importing the bioassay ontology (bao.obo):-

1.  Use the bao.obo file in this project.  It has had to be hand curated to get it to import properly.
2.  The import typically takes longer than the 5 minutes that is the default JBoss transaction timeout.  You must increase the transaction timeout as shown in the standalone.xml file:-

<subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:transactions:3.0">
            <core-environment>
                <process-id>
                    <uuid/>
                </process-id>
            </core-environment>
            <recovery-environment socket-binding="txn-recovery-environment" status-socket-binding="txn-status-manager"/>
            <-- override default timeout !-->
            <coordinator-environment default-timeout="1800"/>
</subsystem>
